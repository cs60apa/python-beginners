#EXAMPLE 1
for z in range (100):
    print(z)
    print()
#this loop will start from 0 all the way to 99 excluding 100

#EXAMPLE 2
show_numbers = list(range(10))
print(show_numbers)
print()
#again here you will see the output from 0 to 9 excluding 10

#EXAMPLE 3
for x in range(10,50):
    print(x)
#the above loop will start from 10 upto 49 excluding 50 it self


for count in range(10):
    print(count)
#here all you try to tell the loop is to write numbers from 0 to 9
